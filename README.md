# Graph-API-Samples #

This repository contains samples of calling the Microsoft Graph APIs using straight HTTP calls. You can use a tool like [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com/) or [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler) to execute the calls. If you use [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com/) you'll be able to have it generate code for you in a variety of languages including cURL, C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, etc.

* [Azure AD v2 Auth Flow](AzureADv2AuthFlow.md) - demonstrates how to authenticate a user and receive an authorization token
* [OneDrive samples](onedrive.md) - once you have an authorization token, you can now start making calls to the OneDrive API.
